### **Storage Layer in Snowflake**

The **Storage Layer** is one of the foundational components of Snowflake's architecture. It handles all data storage responsibilities and provides a highly scalable, secure, and efficient environment. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and design:

---

### **1. Core Functions of the Storage Layer**

- **Data Storage**: Snowflake stores data in a columnar format, optimized for analytics and querying.
- **Separation from Compute**: Storage is completely independent of compute, allowing for dynamic scaling and efficient resource usage.
- **Immutable Micro-Partitions**: Data is divided into small, immutable blocks (micro-partitions) for efficient management and querying.
- **Automatic Compression**: Data is automatically compressed to minimize storage costs.

---

### **2. Key Features**

- **Cloud-Based**: Snowflake uses cloud object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) for durability and scalability.
- **Automatic Optimization**: Data is organized and maintained automatically without manual intervention.
- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted, ensuring security at rest and in transit.
- **Time Travel and Fail-Safe**:
    - **Time Travel**: Enables querying historical data for a specified period (e.g., 1-90 days).
    - **Fail-Safe**: Provides an additional 7-day window to recover data after the Time Travel period.

---

### **3. Components of the Storage Layer**

- **Micro-Partitions**:
    - Data is stored in **columnar format** and divided into micro-partitions (50â€“500 MB).
    - Each micro-partition is automatically indexed with metadata for efficient querying.
- **Metadata Repository**:
    - Tracks information about the micro-partitions, like row counts, min/max values, and distribution of data.
    - Facilitates query optimization by pruning irrelevant micro-partitions.
- **Cloud Object Storage**:
    - Data is stored redundantly across multiple locations for durability and availability.

### What is Query Processing?

Query processing is the work Snowflake does to understand, execute, and return results for your SQL queries. This happens in the **Compute Layer**, which consists of virtual warehouses.

### Cloud Services Layer in Snowflake

The **Cloud Services Layer** is the brain of Snowflake's architecture. It handles all the "management" tasks that keep the platform running smoothly. This layer doesn't process the data directly but ensures that everything works efficiently.

---

### **What Does the Cloud Services Layer Do?**

1. **Query Parsing and Optimization**
    
    - Checks if your SQL query is valid (syntax and structure).
    - Plans the most efficient way to execute the query (e.g., choosing indexes or partitions).
2. **Metadata Management**
    
    - Keeps track of all your data: tables, schemas, columns, and files.
    - Tracks where data is stored and how it's structured in the **Storage Layer**.
3. **Authentication and Access Control**
    
    - Manages user accounts and security.
    - Ensures only authorized users can access data and resources.
4. **Resource Management**
    
    - Allocates compute resources (virtual warehouses) for running your queries.
    - Scales resources up or down based on demand.
5. **Transaction Management**
    
    - Supports **ACID transactions** to ensure data consistency.
    - Handles concurrent queries without conflicts.
6. **Result Caching**
    
    - Stores query results for faster retrieval when the same query is run again.
7. **Data Governance**
    
    - Supports features like data masking, row access policies, and auditing.
    - Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations.

# Table types
### **1. Permanent Table**

- **Description**:
    - A standard table type used for persistent storage of data.
    - The data in these tables remains until explicitly deleted.
    - Data is stored in **Snowflake-managed storage** and benefits from features like replication and time travel.
- **Use Case**:
    - For long-term storage of critical data that needs to be retained and queried regularly.
- **Key Features**:
    - Supports **Time Travel** (1 to 90 days depending on the edition).
    - Can be cloned or restored.

---

### **2. Temporary Table**

- **Description**:
    - A table that exists only for the duration of a session.
    - Data is automatically dropped at the end of the session, and no recovery options are available.
- **Use Case**:
    - For session-specific or intermediate calculations and transformations.
    - Suitable for staging data that is not needed after the session ends.
- **Key Features**:
    - Does not support **Time Travel** or cloning.
    - Not visible to other sessions.

---

### **3. Transient Table**

- **Description**:
    - A table similar to a permanent table but with lower costs.
    - Does not support **Time Travel** or data retention after being dropped.
- **Use Case**:
    - For temporary or less critical data where cost savings are a priority.
    - Data that does not require point-in-time recovery.
- **Key Features**:
    - Faster deletion (no data retention for Time Travel).
    - Ideal for staging or interim processing.

---

### **4. External Table**

- **Description**:
    - A table that references data stored in external cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).
    - Allows querying external data without loading it into Snowflake.
- **Use Case**:
    - For data stored outside Snowflake that needs to be queried or combined with data in Snowflake.
    - Useful for cost-effective access to large, infrequently queried datasets.
- **Key Features**:
    - Read-only access to external data.
    - Requires defining an external stage.

|**Use Case**|Long-term data|Session tasks|Interim tasks|Query external data|
# View 
### 1. **Standard View**

A standard view in Snowflake is simply a stored query that you can use as if it were a table. The data in the view is not physically stored; it is computed each time the view is queried.

- **Creation**:
    
    sql
    `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    
- **Use Case**: Use for abstracting business logic, simplifying complex queries, or restricting access to certain columns or rows.
    

### 2. **Materialized View**

A **materialized view** in Snowflake is a type of view that stores the results of the query in a physical storage location, which is periodically refreshed. Unlike standard views, which are computed at query time, materialized views provide precomputed results that can improve performance for large datasets.

- **Creation**:
    
    sql
    `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    
- **Use Case**: Materialized views are typically used for improving performance on large and complex queries, especially for frequently run reporting or analytical queries.
    
- **Refresh**: Materialized views in Snowflake are automatically refreshed when the underlying data changes. However, you can also manually refresh them.
    
    sql
    
    `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name REFRESH;`
    

### 3. **Secure View**

A **secure view** is a type of view that ensures the underlying query cannot be exposed by users with certain access privileges. The data is protected, and the view itself is more secure, ensuring that sensitive information is handled securely.

- **Creation**:
    
    sql
    `CREATE SECURE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    
- **Use Case**: Secure views are used for sensitive or regulated data where you need to prevent access to the underlying query, providing an additional layer of security.

# Snowflake Scripting
**1. Cursor** is a database object used to retrieve and process query results one row at a time. Cursors are primarily used in **stored procedures** to handle complex query results and allow you to iterate over them row by row.

2.  Result set - When you run a query in Snowflake (or any database), the database processes the query and gives you a **table of data** as output

### Summary of Privileges:

|**Role**|**Key Responsibilities**|**Access Scope**|
|---|---|---|
|**USERADMIN**|Manage user accounts and role assignments|No data access, focuses on user and role management|
|**SECURITYADMIN**|Manage roles, grants, and privileges|No data access, focuses on security and role management|
